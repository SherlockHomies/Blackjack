# Blackjack
This is a beginner project I have just completed for JS
The rules are not the same as traditional Blackjack
The rules are:
  While neither player has exceeded 21 or exactly 21 the game continuous
  The player is dealt a card
  If the player goes above 21 the dealer wins 
  If the player gets exactly 21 the player wins
  The dealer is dealt a card
  If the player goes above 21 the player wins 
  If the player gets exactly 21 the player wins
  
And as this is just a beginner project made by me the code might be inefficient and if you have any suggestions please comment it down below!
